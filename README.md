### Objective
Create an application similar to `bit.ly` - the link shortener using plain React/Redux and Express.

# Back-end Service

## Overview

The back-end is based on [Express](http://http://expressjs.com/), a Node.js web application framework.

## Setup

To setup the server install Node.js in Version 4.4 or newer from the [Node.Js Website](http://nodejs.org/).
Then run the following command in the project root.
This downloads all required dependencies to run the Server.

```bash
npm install
```

## Run the Server

Run the following command in the project root:

```bash
nodemon server.js
```
## Run the Client

Run the following command in the project root:

```bash
node client/frontendserver.js
```


* **Create new short link**

```plain
HTTP POST /v1/links
```

Payload,

```json
{
	"url": "<target-url>"
}
```

Response,

```json
{
	"hash": "<short-link-hash>"
}
```

* **Access short link**

```plain
HTTP GET /v1/{short-link-hash}
```

As response the API should redirect to `target-url`.
